**Goal:** in this newly-initialized swiftui xcode project called xdouble, i want to create an app that can live translate a stream of video from another app's window. my use case is using iphone m
irroring to stream an app in another language to the mac running the program - then the program will have another window showing the contents of the app but with text translated (like google trans
late does for screenshots). i have never written a mac app before so please try extra hard to catch errors as i probably won't. i also have never dealt with live video in place text translation be
fore so dont know the state of the art there. i would prefer something local but would be willing to use an api or smth if required. i'm also prepared to make sacrifices on the translated frame ra
te if necessary. it should support only simplified mandarin for now, at 1-2 fps.                                                                                                                    
**Test Command:** whatever is standard for swiftui and configured in this project. make sure to include a verifiable e2e integration test
