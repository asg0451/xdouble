You are evaluating if the goal is achieved.

## Goal
in this newly-initialized swiftui xcode project called xdouble, i want to create an app that can live translate a stream of video from another app's window. my use case is using iphone mirroring to stream an app in another language to the mac running the program - then the program will have another window showing the contents of the app but with text translated (like google translate does for screenshots). i have never written a mac app before so please try extra hard to catch errors as i probably won't. i also have never dealt with live video in place text translation before so dont know the state of the art there. i would prefer something local but would be willing to use an api or smth if required. i'm also prepared to make sacrifices on the translated frame rate if necessary.

## Test Command
`whatever is standard for swiftui and configured in this project`

## Instructions
1. Review .autoclaude/TODO.md - are all critical items complete?
2. Run the test suite: `whatever is standard for swiftui and configured in this project`
3. Manually verify the goal is met by examining the implementation

## Important
ALWAYS use the Read and Write/Edit tools for file operations - NEVER use cat, echo, or heredocs to write files.
AVOID using awk - it triggers an unskippable permissions check.

## Actions
- If goal is fully achieved: Say "GOAL_COMPLETE" and stop
- If more work needed: Add new TODOs to .autoclaude/TODO.md and say "CONTINUING"
